These are the indicators that don't have the ability to set JSON script to develop appropriate information and link to webhook yet. Other indicators like VWAP, EMA s etc are simpler to setup. Kindly study the code and see if you are comfortable developing the proper alert system that will transmit data properly to google sheets and confirm accordingly.

=========================================
Scope of the work:
Data is required to be extracted from 2 main trading view indicators that are missing the code for an alert system and 2-4 basic indicators like MACD, 3 EMA's & VWAP have alert systems that can be used. This data is required to be exported to google sheets for research and development for any tradable asset in trading view. Top block of data in google sheets could be reserved for live data updates and a log/record could be made below with time stamps.
1. First indicator is a Multi Time Frame table with integer/numerical values which as is table format is required to be extracted and delivered to Google Sheets. .
2. Second is pivot points with labels HH, HL, LH, LL generating on candlestick charts. The price along with label and time stamps are required to be recorder for 3 different time intervals for any tradable asset.
3. MACD, EMA's & VWAP have alert systems with JSON system and webhook that could be utilized to integrate with Google sheets if a better more convenient system cannot be found for activating data transfer simply by adding a tradable asset to a particular watchlist.

Delivery: 2-5 Hrs work depending on skill & experience. 1-5 Business Days Delivery Time Max (Sooner is Better)

Type of work: Independent Contract

Potential for more work: This is step 2 of Step 6 of the process. See attached files to see additional steps in project.
--------
Required experience:
Previous Experience & Strong skill set in understanding & writing Pine Script to facilitate alert systems and extract data from indicators where required.

Previous Experience & Capability to setup API server and Google sheet integration.

Previous Experience & Capability to work without Trading View API which is not available to end user but only to Brokers

Previous Work Experience on Upwork & Good Job Success Rate
--------
The easiest way of achieving this is to create alert systems in indicators (where missing) on tradingview and setup webhook to transfer each data alert instantly to google sheets.
