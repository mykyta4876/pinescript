Job title:
Code a TradingView strategy based on a public TradingView indicator using Pinescript



Job description:
I am looking for someone to code me a strategy with a public indicator on TradingView. This technical indicator is called the “One-Sided Gaussian Filter with Channels”. The code is open to the public and can be copied and edited over TradingView by simply searching it. Long and short entries are created by the following conditions.
Long entry: Go long when the price is outside of the channel and the strategy gives a short signal (The long signal is highlighted with the letter “L”)
Short entry: Go short when the price is outside of the channel and the strategy gives a short signal (The short signal is highlighted with the letter “S”)



Stop loss and take profit:
Take profit: 2500 $
Stop Loss: 2000 $

Our input:
“One-Sided Gaussian Filter with Channels” on TradingView and Ideally on BTC/USDT (Timeframe 1h)

And I need two Versions for the close:

Version 1:
Close position at take profit of 2500$ and stop loss 2000$

Version 2:
Close position when strategy produces a new signal.
For instance: Current open position is long and then there is a short signal, that's when the long position should close and a new short position should open.
