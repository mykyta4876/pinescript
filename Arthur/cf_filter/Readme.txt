Way of working

- Share your own user stories/tasks with me, and update regularly on work done and expected next work and timeline

- Understand the filter and investigate the existing info

- Create a clean code, using Pine Script's best practices

- Create tests in both Python and your TradingView indicator to show that the results are as expected

- Do not focus on nice visuals (max 20min), it's about the filter as a function. At the same time, some user input to play around with the indicator is of course handy.
