Job title:
Code a TradingView strategy based on a public TradingView indicator using Pinescript
Job description:
I am looking for someone to code me a strategy with 2 public indicators on TradingView. These indicator is called the “Guassian Channel” by DonovanWall and the "MACD". The code is open to the public and can be copied. The Strategy has the following conditions:
Entries:
A long entry would be: If the Guassian Chanell is green and the MACD switches from red to green.
A short entry would be: If the Guassian Chanell is red and the MACD switches from green to red.
Stop loss and take profit:
Stop loss is 10% and Take Profit is 1%
Our input:
“Guassian Channel” by DonovanWall and the "MACD" on TradingView
Budget:
20$
(This job shouldn't take more than 1-2 hours of your time)
Time frame:



on the first picture the position would be exit because the MACD candle switched back from green to red
on the second one there is two green MACD candles so the position would stay open until the take profit is reached or the stop loss of -10% is triggered
If you need more help we can also call over google meet, so that I can share my screen and explain it to you.
