to code up an alert based indicator for tradingview
Its based around engulfing candles
Looking for 2, one for bearish engulfing and one for bullish engulfing.

Rules
The previous candle must be in the opposite direction, e.g previous candle is bearish, the new candle closes bullish engulfing.
The engulfing candle must close beyond the previous candles wick.

It would be good to be able to specify what % of a wick the indicator will allow.
e.g 0% on the bullish candle would mean there is no top wick.
