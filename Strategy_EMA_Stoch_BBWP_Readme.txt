the setup is as follows and i will also send screenshot with the settings (most should be default and are all free indicators:

LONG Signal:
- EMA 21 crosses above the 55 EMA
- the BBWP must be below 40% (this one: Bollinger Band Width Percentile from the Caretaker)
- the Stochastic (nor RSI, just the normal Stochastic) must be curving up (going up)

Short Signal:
- EMA 21 crosses below the 55 EMA
- the BBWP must be below 40%
- the Stochastic must be curving down

sample of short trade with the indicators, i put in a vertical white line so you can see the other two indicators position after the EMA cross down

here is long trade example with the indicators, i put the white line where the EMA cross is so you can see the other two indicators.

Let me know if you need something else?

my goal is to be able to set an alarm with your indicator in tradingview when the signals come (both for long and short trade).

i want to upload it in the pine Editor section at the bottom to load as my own indicator
