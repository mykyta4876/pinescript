This Strategy uses the MFI and the 200EMA

The entry condition is:
Go long when the price closes above the 200 ema and when the MFI indicator creates a green dot (Long Signal).
Go short when the price closes below the 200 ema and when the MFI indicator creates a red dot (Short Signal).

The exit condition is:
exit position at a take profit of 0.5% or a stop loss of 2%

This should be used on the SOL/USDT 5min Chart.

The code for the indicators will be provided in the chat and I will attach some problem screenshots to clarify the issue.
