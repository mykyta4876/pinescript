Once you activate the indicator you will see basic price behavior:
To add the signals the following system must be accurate:
Buy alert - enter the 4 hour graph looking for a market structure break (CHOCH) as soon as the break happened the indicator produces a green block, as soon as the graph returns to the 4 hour block enter the 1 minute graph and wait for a structure break (CHOCH) again automatically the indicator produces a block.
If the graph holds the block and doesn't delete it give a buy alert if it deletes it don't give an alert.

Sell ​​alert - enter the 4 hour graph looking for a market structure break (CHOCH) as soon as the break happened the indicator produces a red block, as soon as the graph returns to the 4 hour block enter the 1 minute graph and wait for a structure break (CHOCH) again automatically the indicator produces a block.
If the graph holds the block and does not delete it, give a sell alert; if it deletes it, do not give an alert.

A simple and easy system

In addition, if you receive a signal, I want it to be shown in any timeframe I choose - what's important is that the alert only comes after the system has happened accurately
